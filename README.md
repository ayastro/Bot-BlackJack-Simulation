Simulation of what a BlackJack BOT would look like

The bot would work from an extension that, once activated, would recognize if the player is logged in to the evolution platform and if he was occupying a BlackJack game table, from there the Bot would make decisions, notify the player of profits and show the game history 

This BOT WILL NOT BE PUBLISHED,
because the casino being used DOES NOT ALLOW requests, it is just a mini project with the aim of learning
